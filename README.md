# Find your hat

This is a simple terminal game where you have to find your hat in a field of holes. You can move around using the arrow keys, and you can quit the game by pressing the “ctrl+c” key.

## Installation

To install this game, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the game by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node main.js
```

## Todos

- start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
- Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
- Improve the game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. (<https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit>)
- Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm>)
